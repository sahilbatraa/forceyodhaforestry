summary: A journey from a Java Developer to a Trailblazer.

---
I started my IT career in 2011 and started working on Java Projects. In, 2014 Shifted to Pinkcity(Jaipur, Rajasthan \[India\]) and got a chance to learn Salesforce. Started working as a Developer onto Salesforce Projects and played multiple roles from Developer to Senior developer, Dev Lead to Tech Leads on Projects, and finally ended up being an Architect on Salesforce Projects.

Inspired by Salesforce Community and Leaders, Started training for Freshers within the Organization on Salesforce and then became part of a lovely trailblazer community and got an opportunity to conduct sessions for Students all over India.

Till date, I have trained almost 2000 + Freshers, 2000 + laterals, 5000 + Students, Conducted various Faculty development sessions, and have introduced Salesforce to many of our Young Talents.

I am happy to share that I am starting ForceYodha, a place where everyone in the world will be able to gain Expertise on Salesforce and this will help out Salesforce Community to GROW !!!!

I will be starting a Youtube Channel soon and will be posting a lot of videos that will help you to gain Expertise on Salesforce.

Feel Free to connect with me over Social Media and let me know what blogs or problems I can help you to solve and I will post it in a form of a Blog or Video.
